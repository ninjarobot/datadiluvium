# Installation of the Service

 1. If you don't have Go installed, that's the first step. Install Go.
 2. Fork the project (if you intend to contribute, if you're just going to try it out, skip to step 3)
 3. git clone git@github.com:YourUsername/datadiluvium.git (or git@github.com:Adron/datadiluvium.git if you're just trying it out)
 4. If you don't have *glide* or *hugo* installed, run the `setup.sh` file.
 
This should enable you to run the project with a simple `go run main.go`. As for deployment, that's a different matter and an exercies that I'll leave up to you.

This project is a data generation library for varying databases and other storage mechanisms. For more information on the library ping me [@adron](https://twitter.com/Adron) to ask questions, dive in with some code of your own, or other suggestions or comments.

...and yes, more docs are on their way.  ;-)
