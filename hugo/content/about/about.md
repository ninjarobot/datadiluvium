A little about the origins of the Data Diluvium Project comes from two simple things I wanted. I'm going to assume others may find this useful also. This is the reason I'm moving forward with it from inception as open source software under a basic Apache-2.0 License.

1. A way to generate random data that could be useful for a host of things; testing, data load, sample development, user interface setup, and other related things. You know, basically for everything where you need data to complete a development task efficiently but there usually isn't any. Combine that with the intent and desire to have that data easily generated from a configuration file and inserted into a database or into a file format of my own preference. That's what I, the prospective initial end user, wanted.

2. A project that I could focus and write about, learn ways to implement with Go (while I went about learning the language and tool stack) and also a way to write about other tangential ideas that would have a good core project to reference. This is the other simple thing that I wanted.

Two simple things that actually lead to a full on project that actually has a little bit of complexity to it. In the coming blog articles I'll be writing about the development efforts, issues, and implementation details of the effort.
